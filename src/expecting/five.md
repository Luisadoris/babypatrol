Giving birth can be both exciting and terrifying for first-time moms. Just as the rest of your pregnancy has differed from others’, your birth experience will be unique to you and your baby.As you think about the big day when you’ll finally meet your little one, you probably have questions about what to expect!

Here are some of the most common questions I’ve been asked about giving birth for the first time.

Getting Ready for Baby
How important are birthing classes?
Prenatal classes or birthing classes can help you understand what to expect during your labor and delivery. You’ll learn about creating a birth plan, common things that happen in a hospital, and how to manage pain. At Madison Women’s Health, we refer our patients to Unity Point Meriter for prenatal classes. You can begin taking prenatal classes at the start of your second trimester. We recommend completing them before your 37th week of pregnancy.

Prenatal classes can be online or in person. Check with the hospital to see what they currently offer. Prenatal classes typically include a birth center tour. There are classes for singletons and multiples. They are helpful in understanding various things that can happen in labor and delivery that are not common things you see on TV (like ways to monitor your baby’s heart rate and the use of forceps or a vacuum if needed to safely deliver your baby).

Tip: Prenatal classes will help you think of questions you may want to ask your OB during your prenatal check-ups. Keep a list! Classes are a good supplement to your 10-15 minute prenatal visits.

Who can be with me at the birth?
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no restrictions on how many people could be with you during the birth. During any Public Health Emergency, guidelines may change. It’s always a good idea to verify how many people can be there with you.

At the time this article was written, Meriter allowed one support person (in addition to a doula) to be with you. This person can be anyone — your partner, a friend, or a relative. Choose someone who will be supportive and encouraging. Currently, your support person must be the same person throughout the birthing experience. In other words, your support person cannot be your spouse for a few hours, then your mother, and then your sister.

Tip: A doula is considered part of the medical team and is therefore allowed to be involved in your care during the pandemic.

What is the difference between a midwife and a doula?
Midwives have been trained in obstetric procedures. They can interpret fetal monitoring, make recommendations on labor management, and recommend a C-section if it is needed.

Doulas have been trained in the emotional, psychological, and physical support of moms throughout pregnancy, delivery. and postpartum. They have not been medically trained, but their attention and focus on the mom has been shown to improve birth outcomes. Women who use a doula are more likely to have a delivery without pain medications and their labors tend to be shorter.

Tip: A doula does not make medical recommendations or replace your midwife or doctor, but rather they offer extra services and individualized prenatal and labor support

What will the labor and delivery room or birthing room look like?
Our patients deliver their babies at Meriter Hospital, which has large birthing rooms. You’ll appreciate having more space to walk around in early labor or sit on a birthing ball. You’ll be able to control the temperature and dim the lighting. Your room will have a couch, perfect for your support person to nap on if needed.

Tip: Meriter’s birth rooms also include a comfortable tub. While we don’t offer water births (in accordance with ACOG recommendations), water immersion during labor can help with relaxation and easing labor pain.

What should I pack in my hospital bag?
If you have to drop what you’re doing and immediately go to the hospital, they will have all the essentials. I usually tell patients, however, that it’s a good idea to have a bag ready to go around 36 weeks. There are things you will want to help make your stay more comfortable.
